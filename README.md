Multithreaded server for any number of clients. Clients answer questions one at a time, in the order they registered. Each client has N seconds to respond. The server checks the answers and updates the scores. It synchronizes the clients, giving each the allocated N seconds. Communication is done via sockets, and the questions are stored in SQLite.
